# ChessRobotArm
pick and place robot arm with chess playing feature 

This is the first iteration of my project, which I've named CheBo.It involves a robotic arm designed to hold a real-life chess board and use image processing techniques to identify the chess pieces on the board.
An AI-powered chess engine is then utilized to predict the computer's next move, which is subsequently sent to an Arduino microcontroller to control the robot arm and make the corresponding move on the physical board.
